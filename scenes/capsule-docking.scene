Space travel means different things to different people.

To the tourists, it's a thrill - a chance to escape gravity for the first time in their lives and see the planet from a new perspective.

To the settlers, it's commitment. It means leaving behind everything they've ever known and striking out on the long road to Mars so they can establish something truly new.

To the trillionaires, it's money. It's a finely-tuned production chain that turns asteroids into numbers on a balance sheet. The right asteroid handled the right way will get you a new yacht, a new senator, a new angle in the great game.

But to you, today, space travel means freedom.

Not, like, in the abstract. Not like the "chasing your dreams" kind of freedom. Freedom as in not being cybernetically chained to your desk.

Right now, space travel means hiding in a tiny, cramped cylinder with a shipment of soybeans, in total darkness, with your hands so cold you can't feel them, exhausted from shivering.

The pod is under gravity again; at least you're not floating in space any more. Somebody should be opening the pod soon. Any minute now--

Blinding light makes you flinch as the capsule's lid is opened. A young man's face peers in at you. "Uh... hello. Why are you in my soybeans?"

---
"Help!"
"Sanctury!"
"So...cold..."

===

The words come out slurred, and your vision swims. His expression changes to concern. "You don't look so good. Come on out. Let me get you something hot to drink."

Your muscles are so stiff you can hardly move, but you gradually crawl forward into the bright light. You're in a small room filled with greenery. Plants sprouting from carefully-labeled containers fill half of the room; the other half is a small kitchen. The guy is fussing over a device that's making gurgling noises. 

You hear a whirring sound to your left; a baseball-sized robot flies through the door on four little fans, gripping a blanket in its pincer. It brings you the blanket, which you accept.

There's a soft _ding!_ and the guy turns around and hands you a container with a dark liquid inside. "Here. Coffee."

You slowly sip the coffee, feeling warmth gradually flow back into your body. The guy watches you. He's young, in his twenties. He's wearing an orange robe, a turban, bare feet, and a scraggly beard. He seems nervous. It's probably not every day one of his Amazon packages shows up with a person inside.

"My name is ______."

"Nice to meet you, ${playerName}. I'm Vihaan Khatri. I'm a botanist." He shifts uncomfortably. "So how did you wind up in with my soybeans?"

---

"I made some bad decisions." (Vihaan.trust -10)
"What's the worst job you've ever had?"

===

Vihaan thinks about it. "I had a boss who was a total asshole. Super demanding and never gave me credit for any of my work."

"Okay. Picture that, except you're not allowed to leave."

You take another sip of coffee. It's spicy, with kind of a fruity taste. It tastes like freedom. You grip it a little tighter. "I worked in an orbital warehouse for Amazon.com. Most of the work handling the merchandise is automated. But the automation's not perfect, so each warehouse employs a few people to fix the drones when they get stuck.

"Normally you work 8-hour shifts, so there are 3 shifts. No weekends, but the robots don't always need attention, and a contract only lasts 6 months, and the pay is good.

"It sounded pretty good. Logan Carson, one of my old friends from high school, got made the Baron of North Pacific 9. He says come on up, you can work in my warehouse, it'll be great.

"And it was great, for a while. Barons can run their satellites however they want, as long as the packages arrive on time. Great food, great entertainment. And good friends, too - turns out I wasn't the only one of Logan's high school friends he'd brought up there. My friend Aubrey who I haven't seen in five years works the shift after mine.

"So things are just running along as nice as you please when thing start getting weird between Logan and Aubrey. He starts scheduling a lot of meetings with her one-on-one, buying her gifts, coming by her room while she's off shift, stuff like that. Logan has always been kind of an irresistable force, but if there's one thing Aubrey hates it's being pushed around.

You hold the coffee mug aginst your chest. "I should have seen it coming. In retrospect, the whole reason Logan was hiring people from his high school class was as a power trip. One day Aubrey told him to leave her alone. It was in public, in front of a bunch of people. The next day she was gone.

"Not 'gone' as in fired, either. She didn't show up for work. She wasn't in her room. She wasn't on the station, and none of the passenger shuttles had left. We searched everywhere. She was just gone.
