Space travel means different things to different people.

To the tourists, it's a thrill - a chance to escape gravity for the first time in their lives and see the planet from a new perspective.

To the settlers, it's commitment. It means leaving behind everything they've ever known and striking out on the long road to Mars so they can establish something truly new.

To the trillionaires, it's money. It's a finely-tuned production chain that turns asteroids into numbers on a balance sheet. The right asteroid handled the right way will get you a new yacht, a new senator, a new angle in the great game.

But to you, today, space travel means freedom.

Not, like, in the abstract. Not like the "chasing your dreams" kind of freedom. Freedom as in not being cybernetically chained to your desk.

Right now, space travel means hiding in a tiny, cramped cylinder with a shipment of soybeans, in total darkness, with your hands so cold you can't feel them, exhausted from shivering.

You've been floating in here for several hours now. Somebody should be opening the pod soon. Any minute now--

Blinding light makes you flinch as the capsule's lid is opened. A young man's face peers in at you. "Uh... hello. Why are you in my soybeans?"

---
"Help!"
"Sanctury!"
"So...cold..."

===

The words come out slurred, and your vision swims. His expression changes to concern. "You don't look so good. Come on out. Let me get you something hot to drink."

Your muscles are so stiff you can hardly move, but you nudge the back of the pod and float forward into the bright light. You're in a small room filled with greenery. Plants sprouting from carefully-labeled containers fill half of the room; the other half is a small kitchen. The guy is fussing over a device that's making gurgling noises. 

You hear a _pss_ sound to your left; a baseball-sized robot flies through the door, gripping a blanket in its pincer. It brings you the blanket, which you accept.

There's a soft _ding!_ and the guy turns around and hands you a closed container with a dark liquid inside. "Here. Coffee."

You slowly sip the coffee, feeling warm gradually flow back into your body. The guy watches you. He's young, in his twenties. He's wearing orange high-vis clothing, a turban, and a scraggly beard. He seems nervous. It's probably not every day one of his Amazon packages shows up with a person inside.

"My name is ______."

"Nice to meet you, ${playerName}. I'm Vihaan Khatri. I'm our botanist." He shifts uncomfortably. "So how did you wind up in with my soybeans?"

---

"I made some bad decisions."

===

He laughs quietly. "Okay. Well. This is a new one for me. Uh... I guess first thing is that you need a place to stay. Are you OK? Your lips were looking a little blue there."

Your arms and legs aren't numb any more. Instead they are itching violently. You've read somewhere that the fact that you can feel anything is a good sign.

"I'm good.": Proceed
"Give me a minute.": Continue recovery
