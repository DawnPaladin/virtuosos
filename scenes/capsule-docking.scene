To the trillionaires, it's money. It's a finely-tuned production chain that turns asteroids into numbers on a balance sheet. The right asteroid handled the right way will get you a new yacht, a new senator, a new angle in the great game.

But to you, today, space travel means living. It means air in your lungs. It means not getting shoved into an airlock or a black bag by Amazon Loss Prevention.
