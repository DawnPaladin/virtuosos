You close the door behind you and sag against it with a sigh. Ugh, what a day. "Does anyone _else_ have any terrifying revelations for me?" you ask.

The room explodes into blinding light, casting razor-edged shadows on all four walls. A being of terrifying luminosity, many-winged and covered in eyes, stands in your living room.

*"FEAR NOT."*

> Panic: Angel description

Angel description:

You blink the spots out of your vision and peer at the creature as your eyes adjust.

Hovering an inch above your floor is a gyroscope-looking assembly of wheels, nested at right angles to each other. The wheels sparkle, whir, and flash with energy, filling the air with a metallic, rainy smell.

Floating above this assembly is a glowing being with three faces. An eagle's head looks to your left, a lion's somber visage looks to your right, and looking grimly at you is a man with rough features and wavy brown hair.

A pair of enormous, white, feathery wings jut from his bare shoulders and take up most of the space in your living room. A smaller pair of feathery wings wraps around his torso and fades into the whirring assembly below. 

He's surrounded by glowing white fog, from which forks of lightning occasionally shoot into the floor. Most unnerving of all are the eyes that keep fading in and out on him, on his wings, and on the whirring wheels--they appear, blink at you, then fade away, reappearing in another place to look at something else.

He seems to be waiting for you to say something.

"What the &#$!?":

The creature's expression changes from stern to...weary? You suddenly get the impression it's not happy to be here.

What

"Who are you?":

"I am Rikbiel. I have been sent by the Living God, the Lord of Hosts, to be your guide.

"The Holy One has related to mankind in different ways through different periods of your history. A new chapter is beginning now. The Almighty has seen fit to invest His power into people of His choosing, and to send Cherubim to guide them.

"You are among the chosen."

> "Cherubim?": Cherubim
> "Wait, you're saying you were sent by God?"
> "What do you mean, chosen?": Why did God pick me?
?saw all of ["Who are you?", "Cherubim"]: "Power?": "Why are you here?"

Cherubim:

"I am a cherub, guardian of the Inner Gates, chief of the Celestial Wheel, and now protector of the Lord's Chosen."

---
> "Do you have a name?": "Who are you?"
> "A cherub? Aren't you supposed to be a cute little baby?"

===
"A cherub? Aren't you supposed to be a cute little baby?":

The cherub stares at you impassively. It is not a cute little baby. Somebody should tell the Vatican.

---
> "Do you have a name?": "Who are you?"
?saw all of ["Who are you?", "Cherubim"]: "Why are you here?" = Why

===
"Why did God pick me?":

The cherub shrugs. "God acts through whom He wills. Sometimes he acts through those who have demonstrated reliable good character. Other times he acts through the weak, to show that He can. God's kingdom is not a meritocracy."

---
> "What are you?": Cherubim
Why

===
"Wait, you're saying you were sent by God?":

He rises slightly off the floor. "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts! He is worthy to receive all honor and glory and power in the universe, for He created all things, and by His will they live and move and have their being." The creature's radiance increases, and the air is filled with thunder and lightning.

> "Hang on. I don't believe in God."
> "Why did God pick me?"

===
"Hang on. I don't believe in God.":

He nods. "I am aware. God loves you no less for it. That is not a prerequisite for participation in this program."

!"Why are you here?":

"God has communicated with humans in different ways through different eras of history--sometimes face-to-face, sometimes through prophets, sometimes through books and letters. For the last two thousand years, God has worked unseen, whispering to those who seek Him.

"Humankind is entering into a new era. You are taking your first steps out into the solar system--not merely to visit, but to stay. Humans have created a new race of intelligent machines, and are deciding what their relationship with them will be. Humans are modifying themselves with gene therapy and cybernetics. You are encountering not only new moral questions but new _kinds_ of moral questions.

"In the past, when new moral questions arose, those who follow God would extrapolate his existing commands and apply them to the new situation. There lies the danger. Tell me, human: which verses of Scripture should you look to to determine whether to alter yourself cybernetically?"

> "If cybernetics give me more capability to love God and my neighbor, I would.": Trick question
> "I will remain pure before God. I won't alter what God has given me.": Trick question

Trick question:

"Did you choose that after earnestly studying Scripture, or did you pick the answer that fit your existing belief structures? The question is rhetorical--Scripture provides *no guidance* in this area. And these decisions matter!

"To help humanity navigate this new era, God has chosen a new way of communicating with humanity. He is gifting certain people with a measure of his power. This power will manifest in different ways and at different strengths depending on the person's character.

"I am here as a liason--to answer your questions about how this gift of power works. Parts of it will be counterintuitive. But the goal is to make right and wrong more clear and less ambiguous.

"To that end, I will be your companion for the time being. Say my name and I will appear. I will also protect you from the forces of the Opposer, who has taken great interest in this project."
